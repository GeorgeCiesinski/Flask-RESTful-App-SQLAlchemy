Flask Restful App

This is a basic flask restful app that uses GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods.

The data is stored in a SQLite3 database using raw SQL commands.

# Implementation

1. Run App.py

```
python app.py
```

2. Use POSTMAN to interact with API as there is no companion front end for this API.
