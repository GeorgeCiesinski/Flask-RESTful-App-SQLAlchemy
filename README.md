Flask Restful App

This is a basic flask restful app that uses GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods.

The data is stored in a SQLite3 database using raw SQL commands.

How to use:

1. CD into app folder and create the Tables

```
cd app
python create_tables.py
```

2. Run App.py

```
python app.py
```

3. Use POSTMAN to interact with API.
